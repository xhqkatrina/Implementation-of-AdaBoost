# Implementation-of-AdaBoost
This repository includes an implementaion of AdaBoost in R. It solves a classification problem, classifying whether the handwritten digit is 3 or 8. The final result always includes a graph that plots the cross validation training and test error as the number of weak classifiers increases.
